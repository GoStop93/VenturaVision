For calculations, we'll need a floor plan of the object, indicating the names (purposes) and areas of all rooms, as well as the ceiling height.",
    "text_2": "Fresh air needs to be supplied only to those rooms where people can stay for extended periods: bedrooms, living rooms, offices, etc. Air is not supplied to corridors, and it is removed from the kitchen and bathrooms through exhaust ducts. Thus, the scheme of airflows will look like this: fresh air is supplied to living areas, from there it (already partially polluted) enters the corridor, from the corridor – to bathrooms and the kitchen, from where it is removed through exhaust ventilation, carrying away unpleasant odors and pollutants. Such a scheme of air movement ensures air pressure in 'dirty' rooms, eliminating the possibility of unpleasant odors spreading throughout the apartment or cottage.",
